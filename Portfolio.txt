Raveen Shalom Rodney — Modern portfolio website brief

Short intro / summary (for hero & meta):
Raveen Shalom Rodney is a web developer and prompt engineer who builds clean, responsive web experiences and crafts effective AI prompts. The site should present Raveen as a practical, creative technologist — skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive UI and AI prompt engineering — and highlight a completed AI-driven YouTube video project and an internship at Future Interns (Prompt Engineering). Include a professional profile photo in the hero (headshot, centered or left-aligned).

Detailed content & instructions by section
1) Home / Hero

Full-screen hero with subtle futuristic background (soft animated SVG lines or gradient + mild parallax). Primary palette: shades of gray (light and dark) + a single subtle accent (electric cyan or teal) for highlights — keep the futuristic touch restrained.

Left or center content:

Headline: “Raveen Shalom Rodney — Web Developer & Prompt Engineer”

Subheadline / tagline: “Building clean, responsive websites and crafting AI prompts for smarter workflows.”

Short one-line bio snippet (from user).

CTA buttons: “View Work” (scroll to Portfolio) and “Contact” (mailto link).

Profile picture: high-quality headshot (square or circular crop) displayed prominently near the headline. Use a thin neon/gradient ring or glassy card behind the image for the subtle futuristic look.

2) About

2–3 paragraph expanded bio using user’s text:

Who you are, what you enjoy (clean responsive websites, combining tech + AI), and career goals (implied: improve UX, build smarter solutions).

Education block:

“Currently in 3rd year of college” — show as timeline/badge: College — 3rd Year (expected graduation year optional if user adds).

Visual: small timeline or cards for quick facts (Location — India if desired; Languages/stack badges).

Small “fun detail” or interests line to humanize (optional).

3) Skills

Two grouped columns: Web Development and Prompt Engineering / AI Tools

Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Responsive Design, UI/UX Basics, Git & GitHub.

AI / Prompt Engineering: Prompt Design & Optimization, ChatGPT / OpenAI API, Midjourney (if used), AI Workflow Automation, Content Generation & Ideation.

For each skill show a short proficiency indicator (e.g., bars or dots) and short one-line examples of how you use the skill (e.g., “Responsive Design — mobile-first layout and CSS grid/flex”).

Include a small code snippet box (styled, monospace) that demonstrates a tiny JavaScript or HTML snippet authored by Raveen — makes the site feel technical and authentic.

4) Portfolio / Projects

Grid of project cards (responsive).

Each card: thumbnail, title, short blurb, tags (e.g., JavaScript, AI, Video), and link to details or modal.

INCLUDE the notable project:

AI YouTube Video (featured) — title placeholder, short description: “Fully functional AI-generated YouTube video — outlines the workflow, tools used (OpenAI/Midjourney/other), and development steps (prompt design, automation, video assembly).” Add a prominent “View project” button that either links to the live video (YouTube) or opens a project page with:

Problem statement

Approach & AI prompts used (show sanitized prompt examples)

Tech stack and scripts used

Screenshots / video embed / demo

Project detail pages should contain code snippets, screenshots, and a short case study (challenge → solution → outcome).

5) Experience & Education

Timeline vertical layout:

Internship: Prompt Engineering Intern — Future Interns (show as internship; if possible add dates — allow input later).

Education: “Currently in 3rd year of college” (show college name if provided later and expected graduation year).

Each timeline card: role, organization, short description of responsibilities/achievements (for the internship, highlight prompt design work and AI workflows).

6) Services & Collaboration (since user answered “no” to offering services)

Copy options:

Option A (explicit): “Currently not offering paid services. Open to collaborations, internships, and project-based conversations.”

Option B (soft): Omit a formal services page, but include a short “Work with me” CTA linking to Contact.

Provide a short “Available for” list (optional): collaborations, internships, mentorship — user can choose.

7) Contact

Primary contact: email button that opens mailto:raveenshalomrodney@gmail.com.

Optional contact form: name, email, message, and a hidden spam trap; on submit use mailto or Netlify/Form backend. Also add a downloadable CV/Resume button.

Include a small privacy note: “I respond to collaboration and internship enquiries via email.”

8) Footer

Repeat email and copyright, small nav, optionally social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn) if user later provides links.

Visual & design guidance

Overall aesthetic: Minimalist + subtle futuristic. Gray-dominant palette (examples: #0f1720 for deep dark, #1f2937 mid-gray, #e5e7eb light gray), accent: subtle cyan/teal (#00d4ff or #00c2b2) used sparingly for buttons, link underlines, hover glows.

Typography: Modern sans-serif (Inter or Poppins) for body; slightly bolder display for headline. Monospace for code snippets (e.g., Fira Code).

Layout: Clean grid with generous whitespace. Responsive mobile-first design. Card components with rounded corners (8–12px), soft shadows and glassmorphism panels for the “futuristic but not loud” feel.

Micro-interactions: subtle hover lift on project cards, link underline animation, small transitions for buttons and modals (150–250ms ease).

Hero animation: Subtle moving lines, animated gradient or low-opacity particle mesh — keep motion limited and non-distracting.

Icons: Use lightweight SVG icons for skills and contact (feathericons / lucide).

Accessibility: High contrast text on gray backgrounds; keyboard navigable; alt text for images and transcripts/captions for video content.

UX & technical requirements

Tech stack suggestion: Static site using HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or Next.js / React if dynamic), host on GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify. Use Git + GitHub for version control.

Performance: Optimize images and video thumbnails, lazy-load embeds, minify assets, and keep page weight low.

SEO & meta: Title & description tags, Open Graph image (use a stylized headshot or project image), structured data for Person/Portfolio.

Project sources: Link to GitHub repositories or include code snippets where possible.

Contact handling: Simple mailto and optionally serverless form (Netlify forms or similar).

Assets & copy to provide (placeholders to replace with real content)

Profile headshot (high-res).

Short bio (use the provided bio).

Education details (college name & expected grad year — user to provide later).

Internship details (Future Interns — add date range if available).

Project assets: thumbnail images, YouTube link for the AI video, short case-study text, example prompts (sanitized).

Email: raveenshalomrodney@gmail.com
 (use in contact and mailto).

Optional social links (GitHub / LinkedIn) if user wants them shown later.

Final developer/designer prompt (single-paragraph, ready to hand to a builder or AI site generator)

Design and build a clean, responsive portfolio website for Raveen Shalom Rodney, a web developer and prompt engineer. Use a gray-dominant palette with a restrained futuristic accent color (subtle cyan/teal). The site must include a hero with a professional headshot, short tagline, CTAs (“View Work”, “Contact”), an About section (include “currently in 3rd year of college”), Skills grouped into Web Development and Prompt Engineering, a Projects grid with a featured case study for a fully functional AI YouTube video, an Experience timeline highlighting an internship at Future Interns (Prompt Engineering), and a Contact section using mailto:raveenshalomrodney@gmail.com. Prioritize readability, accessibility, and performance. Include code snippet styling for technical authenticity, subtle animated background elements for a futuristic feel (non-distracting), responsive layout, and deployable static build (GitHub Pages/Vercel). Provide project detail pages with screenshots, prompt examples, and video embeds. Keep interactions smooth and micro-animated; use modern fonts (Inter/Poppins) and monospace for code. Deliver source code on GitHub and include instructions to edit personal content later.
